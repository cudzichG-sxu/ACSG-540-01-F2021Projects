        Illinois, constituent state of the United States of America.
        It stretches southward 385 miles (620 km) from the Wisconsin border in the north to Cairo in the south.
        In addition to Wisconsin, the state borders Lake Michigan to the northeast, Indiana to the east, Kentucky to the
        southeast, Missouri to the west, and Iowa to the northwest.
        Illinois was named for the Illinois Indians.
        The capital is Springfield, in the west-central part of the state.

        Admitted as the 21st member of the union on December 3, 1818, Illinois lies within both the so-called old
        industrial belt and the fertile agricultural heart of the country.
        The presence of Chicago, one of the country’s most prominent cities, creates sharp distinctions between the
        state’s largely urban and suburban northeast and the more evenly balanced urban-rural population downstate.
        In political life, Illinois is divided between Cook county (which contains much of the Chicago metropolitan
        area) and “downstate”—that is, all the other counties, even those north of Cook, such as Lake county.
        Although its northern portion touches the Upper Midwest, its southern point is actually farther south than
        Richmond, Virginia, and has great affinities with neighbouring Kentucky and Missouri.
        Further contrasts derive from the racial and ethnic complexity of the population.
    </p>
    <p class="p3">
        These internal divisions, while not unique to Illinois, perhaps became magnified through the state’s critical
        role in the economic and political life of the country.
        Rich in coal and petroleum reserves and ideally located for the acquisition of raw materials and distribution of
        finished goods, Illinois ranks among the top states in value of exports, agricultural income, and value added by
        manufacturing.
        Chicago is a national railroad hub, the city’s O’Hare International Airport is among the world’s busiest, and
        Illinois highways and waterways are thick with commercial traffic.
        Politically, Illinois has tended to be a “swing state,” its votes often mirroring fluctuating social tensions
        that underlie the growing, but unevenly distributed, economic prosperity.
        Area 57,914 square miles (149,996 square km). Population (2020) 12,822,739.
    </p>
    <p class="p1">
        Much of Illinois’s land is flat, with irregular plains in the western, northern, and southern sections.
        This area once constituted a vast tallgrass prairie, virtually all of which was converted to farmland or urban
        sprawl.
        The unglaciated southernmost part of the state is in many ways out of character with the rest of Illinois.
        Shawnee National Forest, the only large tract of federally administered land in Illinois, covers a great part of
        this region.
        Southern Illinois consists of gently sloping, open hills.
        Rolling hills in the northwestern corner include the state’s highest point, Charles Mound, which is 1,235 feet
        (376 metres) above sea level.
        The statewide average elevation is about 600 feet (180 metres).
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
        Illinois is drained by as many as 900 streams emptying mostly into the Mississippi River system.
        The Chicago and Calumet rivers—originally flowing into the St. Lawrence by way of Lake Michigan—have been
        altered through the construction of canals to drain into the Mississippi by way of the Illinois River, which
        roughly bisects the northern portion of the state from northeast to southwest.
        The Ohio River joins the Mississippi at the state’s southern tip near Cairo, an area known as “Little Egypt.”
        Water lies under all of Illinois in natural underground reservoirs.
        Chicago and many of its suburbs draw their water from Lake Michigan, but most of northern Illinois’s water is
        pumped from underground wells.
        Some regions face a dwindling water supply; around Joliet the water table has been lowered hundreds of feet
        since the early 20th century.
        Most of the state’s lakes are man-made.
    </p>
    <p class="p3">
        Because of its geographic position and its long north-south axis, Illinois experiences wide regional variations
        in temperature.
        Across the state, seasonal temperature variation also tends to be great, with typically cold, snowy winters and
        hot summers; extremes are somewhat ameliorated around Lake Michigan.
        Mean winter temperatures are about 22 °F (−6 °C) in the north and 37 °F (3 °C) in the south; summer equivalents,
        respectively, are 74 °F (23 °C) and 80 °F (27 °C).
        Mean annual precipitation in the north is about 34 inches (864 mm) and in the south 46 inches (1,170 mm).
        The growing season varies from 205 days in the south to 155 days in the northernmost counties.
