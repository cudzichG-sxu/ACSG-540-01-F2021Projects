    <h1>Details about my home.</h1>
    <p>
        My home is a three story house that consists of a basement, a middle area where the living room and kitchen reside, and an 
        upstairs that contains three bedrooms and one bathroom. The house mainly brick with some areas containing vinyl siding.
        The garage can fit two vehicles of small to medium size and probably one <span id="phraseOne" onmouseover="setProperties(this);" onmouseout="setBackToNormal(this);">fully built truck</span>. The house was built in the 1970's
        so <span id="phraseTwo"  onmouseover="setProperties(this);" onmouseout="setBackToNormal(this);">popcorn ceiling unfortunately</span> still a thing inside this house. We've probably remodeled the inside of this house four or five 
        times <span id="phraseThree"  onmouseover="setProperties(this);" onmouseout="setBackToNormal(this);">since moving here in 2001</span>.
