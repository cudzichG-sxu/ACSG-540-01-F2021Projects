    <h3>Professional History</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> Grzegorz Cudzich first began his Computer Science journey in 2014, where he helped his brother in law by performing basic I.T task
        such as repairing computers for clients and installing software within office buildings. Later on during high school, Greg took a 
        course called A+ Computer repair. While the course did provide helpful information from the different topics that we touched on, 
        it was ultimately a fluke since the teacher of the course was the main I.T individual for the school district. So from the middle of
        the school year all the way to the end, the course was mainly about OSHA certification. However, one topic peaked Gregs interests 
        within the course, which was the topic of converting binary to hexadecimal and decimal. After a short chat with his teacher, Greg 
        enrolled into the AP Computer Science course for his senior year of high school.

    <p> While the first half of the AP Computer Science course went well for Greg, once arraylists were covered it all went downhill from there.
        Confused about the many topics covered after arraylists, Greg was struggling to understand what the AP Computer Science teacher was, well, teaching.
        After barely scrapping past with an B in the class, Greg still wanted to pursue a career in Software Development. After chatting with a Professor 
        at a Saint Xavier University open house, this began the career path of Greg.

    <p> Greg now works at ChangEd Inc. where he is currently an iOS developer. He's been with the company for 3 plus years and started off 
        as an intern during summer 2018. During his time at ChangEd Inc he has dipped his foot into Android development using Kotlin, Backend 
        development using Node.js, iOS development using Swift, and web development using React. Greg has also worked with Firebase Analytics, BigQuery,
        and Google Data Studio on many different analytical pieces to help investors and his higher ups with visualizing analytical data from users.
